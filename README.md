# Notice

It is important to note that I have never tried to host a LaTex document, so I will do my best to make sure it works and is editiable for those who download it. The document was originally created in [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), which is a Google-Docs-meets-LaTex site that I highly recommend. I downloaded the files and was able to compile and save the document on locally on my computer without too much trouble using Texmaker and MikTex. 

Here are the files (slightly modified from Overleaf) that were successfully run on my computer. I hope you use these files to spread more humor in this dark world.

A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE DEAN:

The A. James Clark School of Engineering is proud to announce that researchers in the Department of Mechanical Engineering have received the prestigious F. Walker Award for Innovative Research for their latest project, a novel cryptoencabulator!

The cryptoencabulator makes use of cutting edge blockchain technology, leveraging the design freedom allowed by microwave lithography to inductively 3-D print vascularized biomaterials.

The interdisciplinary team comprised of Seniors Saul Schaffer and Brian Bock has spent the last 18 months designing the ideal torque-deflection relationship of the cryptoencabulator dingle arm. By modular flagellation of the Pinot microtubules, the team was able to successfully undulate an electrofluidic three phase stator. The impact of this work spans fields from mechanics, electronics, robotics, encryption, machine design, artificial intelligence, and inverse mathematics, and is expected to have disruptive effects on the development of 3D printed carbon zeta tubes as well as artificially confrontational deep neural networks (CDNNs).

Previous encabulators operated on the principle of power generation through the relative motion of conductors and fluxes produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive duractance. The original encabulator, known as the turbo encabulator, had a base plate of prefabulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzel vanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar wane shaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.

The new cryptoencabulator, by contrast, incorporates distilled thiotimoline to enable the use of non time-invariant couplings to maintain the chrono-stability of the temporal reflectors. A thin walled cavorite chamber isolates the copper geodesic bearings from gravitational influences, preventing quantum tunneling through the arenak buffer, crucial to the safe operation of the system.

Once again, congratulations and GO TERPS!"
