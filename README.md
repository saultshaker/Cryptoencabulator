This reserves to host the source files (.tex, .bib, etc) for the 2019 April Fool's Day prank pulled by Saul Schaffer &amp; Brian Bock on the entire A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park.

# Notice

It is important to note that I have never tried to host a LaTex document, so I will do my best to make sure it works and is editiable for those who download it. The document was originally created in Overleaf (https://overleaf.com), which is a Google-Docs-meets-LaTex site that I highly recommend. I downloaded the files and was able to compile and save the document on locally on my computer without too much trouble using Texmaker and MikTex. 

Here are the files (slightly modified from Overleaf) that were successfully run on my computer. I hope you use these files to spread more humor in this dark world.
